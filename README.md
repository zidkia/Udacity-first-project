Boston Airbnb prices


## Motivation
In this project, I'm intreaded to see how Airbnb prices changes. As someone who lived for a few months (during internship) in Boston, I'm very intresing to get some insites about the housing / Airbnb market. 

In this project, I'll answer the folowing question:
1. Do Airbnb prices increase over the years?
2. Do Airbnb prices correlated with Airbnb reviews rating?
3. Do bigger Airbnb increase prices?

Also, I'll add a linear model to predect Airbnb prices with the variables that I investigate in the questions: rating, size and year.

## Files 
1. Read me file - get some info about the project before diving into it.
2. Jupyter notebook - with all the code, and comments of my analysis.
3. Documentation with all the findings from my projects.


## Libraries 
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Mtplotlib
5. Sklearn (linear_model, model_selection, metrics)

## Results
1. Airbnb prices decrease between 2016 to 2017.
2. Airbnb reviews rating is not correlated with Airbnb prices. quite the opposite, they have negative small correlation.
3. Bigger Airbnb (by square feet or by numbers of beds) have high correlation with Airbnb prices.
4. Using only Airbnb reviews and size with a linear regression gives r*2 of 0.34. Meaning that 34% of the price can be explained by these two variables.
