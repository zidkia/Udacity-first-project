# Udacity-first-project
Boston Airbnb prices


## Motivation
In this project, I'm intreaded to see how Airbnb prices changes. As someone who lived for a few months (during internship) in Boston, I'm very intresing to get some insites about the housing / Airbnb market. 

In this project, I'll answer the folowing question:
1. Do Airbnb prices increase over the years?
2. Do Airbnb prices correlated with Airbnb review rating?
3. Do bigger Airbnb increase prices?

Also, I'll add a linear model to predect Airbnb prices with the variables that I investigate in the questions: rating, size and year.

## Files 
1. Read me file - get some info about the project before diving into it.
2. Jupyter notebook - with all the code, and comments of my analysis.
3. Documentation with all the findings from my projects.


## Libraries 
A README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgments.
